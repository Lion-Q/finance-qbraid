## Introduction
Portfolio optimization, rooted in the principles of Mod
ern Portfolio Theory (MPT) as introduced by Harry
Markowitz in 1952, seeks to maximize expected returns
while minimizing risk through the strategic allocation of
assets. This process typically involves the use of a covari
ance matrix to analyze the relationships between various
assets, alongside metrics such as the Sharpe ratio to eval
uate performance. However, the complexity of these op
timization problems often categorizes them as NP-hard,
presenting significant challenges in computational feasi
bility. Traditional methods, including Monte Carlo simu
lations and maximum diversification techniques, struggle
to efficiently navigate the vast solution space inherent in
large portfolios.
In recent years, advancements in quantum computing
have opened new avenues for tackling these complex op
timization problems. Notable contributions from orga
nizations such as IBM and D-Wave have demonstrated
the potential of quantum algorithms to outperform clas
sical approaches. Quantum algorithms, such as the Vari
ational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), offer unique advan-
tages in optimizing asset allocation and risk management
by leveraging quantum superposition and entanglement.
These techniques can explore multiple solutions si
multaneously, significantly reducing the time required to
identify optimal strategies in dynamic market conditions.
As the financial industry continues to embrace these in-
novations, we can expect a paradigm shift in how invest
ment strategies are developed and executed, ultimately
leading to more robust and resilient portfolios. Thus, it
makes sense that the motivation behind this challenge
lies in understanding the potential of quantum comput
ing to revolutionize traditional financial models and en
hance decision-making processes through an analysis of
time and space complexity as well as scalability
